// Implementation for Float64.
//
// jhrg 9/7/94

// $Log: Float64.cc,v $
// Revision 1.16  1995/12/06 21:35:20  jimg
// Changed read() from three to two parameters.
// Removed store_val() and read_val() (use buf2val() and val2buf()).
//
// Revision 1.15  1995/08/26  00:31:29  jimg
// Removed code enclosed in #ifdef NEVER #endif.
//
// Revision 1.14  1995/08/22  23:57:50  jimg
// Removed deprecated member functions.
// Changed read_val/Store_val to buf2val/val2buf.
//
// Revision 1.13  1995/07/09  21:28:56  jimg
// Added copyright notice.
//
// Revision 1.12  1995/05/10  15:33:57  jimg
// Failed to change `config.h' to `config_dap.h' in these files.
//
// Revision 1.11  1995/05/10  13:45:14  jimg
// Changed the name of the configuration header file from `config.h' to
// `config_dap.h' so that other libraries could have header files which were
// installed in the DODS include directory without overwriting this one. Each
// config header should follow the convention config_<name>.h.
//
// Revision 1.10  1995/03/16  17:26:38  jimg
// Moved include of config_dap.h to top of includes.
// Added TRACE_NEW switched dbnew debugging includes.
//
// Revision 1.9  1995/03/04  14:34:42  jimg
// Major modifications to the transmission and representation of values:
// 	Added card() virtual function which is true for classes that
// 	contain cardinal types (byte, int float, string).
// 	Changed the representation of Str from the C rep to a C++
// 	class represenation.
// 	Chnaged read_val and store_val so that they take and return
// 	types that are stored by the object (e.g., inthe case of Str
// 	an URL, read_val returns a C++ String object).
// 	Modified Array representations so that arrays of card()
// 	objects are just that - no more storing strings, ... as
// 	C would store them.
// 	Arrays of non cardinal types are arrays of the DODS objects (e.g.,
// 	an array of a structure is represented as an array of Structure
// 	objects).
//
// Revision 1.8  1995/02/10  02:22:47  jimg
// Added DBMALLOC includes and switch to code which uses malloc/free.
// Private and protected symbols now start with `_'.
// Added new accessors for name and type fields of BaseType; the old ones
// will be removed in a future release.
// Added the store_val() mfunc. It stores the given value in the object's
// internal buffer.
// Made both List and Str handle their values via pointers to memory.
// Fixed read_val().
// Made serialize/deserialize handle all malloc/free calls (even in those
// cases where xdr initiates the allocation).
// Fixed print_val().
//
// Revision 1.7  1995/01/19  20:05:18  jimg
// ptr_duplicate() mfunc is now abstract virtual.
// Array, ... Grid duplicate mfuncs were modified to take pointers, not
// referenves.
//
// Revision 1.6  1995/01/11  15:54:31  jimg
// Added modifications necessary for BaseType's static XDR pointers. This
// was mostly a name change from xdrin/out to _xdrin/out.
// Removed the two FILE pointers from ctors, since those are now set with
// functions which are friends of BaseType.
//
// Revision 1.5  1994/12/09  21:35:58  jimg
// Used the XDR_INT32 and XDR_FLOAT64 symbols defined in config.h.
//
// Revision 1.4  1994/11/29  20:10:39  jimg
// Added functions for data transmission.
// Added boolean parameter to serialize which, when true, causes the output
// buffer to be flushed. The default value is false.
// Added FILE *in and *out parameters to the ctor. The default values are
// stdin/out.
// Removed the `type' parameter from the ctor.
//
// Revision 1.3  1994/11/22  14:05:46  jimg
// Added code for data transmission to parts of the type hierarchy. Not
// complete yet.
// Fixed erros in type hierarchy headers (typos, incorrect comments, ...).
//
// Revision 1.2  1994/09/23  14:36:10  jimg
// Fixed errors in comments.
//
// Revision 1.1  1994/09/15  21:08:40  jimg
// Added many classes to the BaseType hierarchy - the complete set of types
// described in the DODS API design documet is now represented.
// The parser can parse DDS files.
// Fixed many small problems with BaseType.
// Added CtorType.
//
// Revision 1.1  1994/09/09  15:38:45  jimg
// Child class of BaseType -- used in the future to hold specific serialization
// information for integers. Should this be a class that uses BaseType?
